# faa-waypoints-renamed
A list of the 368 FAA navigation waypoints that have been changed from Jan. 2015 - Jan. 2024. 

Data for the story ["The Naughty Words the FAA Removed From the Sky"](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/trump-naughty-faa-waypoints/). 

The data comes from a FOIA request to the Federal Aviation Administration. 

The original spreadsheet from the request is "Fix names (to 5-char) chgd between 1_1_2015  1_15_2024.xls" and the cleaned up version is "trump_foia_waypoints_city_state.csv."
